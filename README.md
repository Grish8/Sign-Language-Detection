Random Forest (used in training the models)
    A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that aggregates the results of multiple decision trees.
    It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode (majority vote) for classification tasks or the average for regression tasks.
    It is particularly well-suited for structured/tabular data, like the data array used in this code.
